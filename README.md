This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own [RPG].
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your team know.

Your game must follow the following rules:
- The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.
- The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.
- There must be NPC in your game.
- You need to implement at least one quest.
- The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.
- The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.
- With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.

To give the users the feeling that youâ€™re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible your game.
- Having a pleasant user interface.
- Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)
- Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
- Create a game with a beginning and an end.

> :bulb: You should think and look for information about how to create a simple yet entertaining RPG.
